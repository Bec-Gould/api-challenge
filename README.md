## Part 1 - WeatherPy

#### Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
    -Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    -Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    -Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    -Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

#### Run linear regression on each relationship, separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
    -Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

#### Your final notebook must:
    -Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
    -Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
    -Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
    -Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

## Part 2 - VacationPy

#### Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.

#### Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.  
    -A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
    -Wind speed less than 10 mph.
    -10% cloudiness.
    -Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

#### Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

#### Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
